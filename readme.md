# GO HTTP 1.1 Server 
Very basic HTTP 1.1 server spec'd off RFC 9110 implemented from scratch in Go. Includes:
- Request Lines
- Headers
- Body

Obviously not nearly all of the features and specs are implemented as this project was meant for me to learn more about the HTTP protocol as well as practice with go. 

Also included a chunked encoding implementation
